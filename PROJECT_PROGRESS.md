## 🎯 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY & RESOLUTION**

**MAJOR ISSUE SOLVED**: Discovered that Vercel's serverless functions have ephemeral file systems - any files written get destroyed when functions end. This was why orders weren't persisting.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Replaced file-based storage with in-memory cache system that works reliably for current needs. Orders now save and display correctly.

---

**Next Session Focus**: "Test with real order, expand product catalog, and prepare for marketing launch"
