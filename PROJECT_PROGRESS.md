**Project Status: OnlyInTX Store - Printify Integration Complete**

**What We Accomplished:**
1. ✅ **Debugged Printful vs Printify confusion** - rebuilt all APIs for Printify
2. ✅ **Successfully connected to Printify API** - all 4 shops connected including OnlyInTX (Shop ID: 18727817)
3. ✅ **Created Printify integration system** with proper error handling
4. ✅ **Built product creation workflow** for Texas designs

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `pages/api/printify/test.js` - Connection testing (working)
- `pages/api/printify/products.js` - Product CRUD operations
- `pages/api/printify/blueprints.js` - Get available product types
- `pages/admin/printify-test.js` - Admin connection test page (working)
- `components/PrintifyProductCreator.js` - Product creation component
- `components/DesignManager.js` - Design upload/selection system
- `.env.local` with `PRINTIFY_API_KEY` (1300 char JWT token working)

**Current State:**
- Printify API connected and tested ✅
- 4 Texas designs ready to upload (1 per major city)
- Need to install `formidable` for file uploads: `npm install formidable`

**Next Steps:**
1. Add PrintifyProductCreator to admin products page
2. Upload Texas designs using DesignManager
3. Create first products in OnlyInTX shop
4. Set up Stripe payment integration
5. Update homepage to display real products from Printify

**Admin Products Page:** Add the component alongside existing content, don't replace.

**Recommendation:** Add this summary to both the next chat AND your project guide for reference.

Ready to continue with design uploads and product creation! 🤠

**⚠️ Chat Limit Reminder: We're approaching 80% of our conversation limit!**

Before we hit the limit, here's a **summary for your next phase**:

## **Phase 3 Summary - What's Working:**
✅ Printify API fully connected (Vercel + Local)  
✅ Real products loading with correct data (32-38 variants)  
✅ Pricing updates working in Printify  
✅ Products properly unpublished and editable  

## **Remaining Issue:**
🔄 **Frontend caching** - Admin shows old data (439 variants) despite API returning correct data

## **Next Session Priorities:**
1. **Fix frontend cache** - Force admin to use fresh API data
2. **Complete bulk pricing** - Apply $32+ to all products  
3. **Add Stripe integration** - Payment processing
4. **Connect products to site** - Display on city pages

## **Code Status:**
- `/pages/api/printify/products.js` - ✅ Working perfectly
- `/pages/admin/products.js` - 🔄 Needs cache fix
- Environment variables - ✅ Set in Vercel

## **For Next Session:**
"I have a working Printify API integration, but my admin frontend is showing cached variant data (439) instead of fresh API data (32-38). Need to fix React state management and caching issues, then proceed with Stripe integration."

**You've made incredible progress!** The hard API integration work is done. 🚀
